Step 1: Activate the Plugin:
  Go to your WordPress dashboard.
  Navigate to Plugins > Installed Plugins.
  Find WooCommerce Refund Enable and click Activate.
  
How It Works:
The plugin enables the refund amount field in WooCommerce orders by removing the readonly attribute from the #refund_amount field using JavaScript.
The function ff_enable_woocommerce_refund_field is triggered in the WordPress admin panel when viewing the shop_order post type (WooCommerce orders).
You can now manage refunds directly from the order page without restrictions!
